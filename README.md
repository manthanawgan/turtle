Building a Shell in C++ from Scratch

## Overview
simple shell implemented in C++ that replicates basic Unix shell behavior. It allows users to execute commands, navigate directories, and interact with their system from the terminal.

## Features (what i've built)
- Continuous shell loop for input
- Command parsing and execution
- Built-in cd support
- Custom prompt with current working directory

## What i'll be adding
- Background execution (&)
- I/O redirection (>, >>)
- Command piping (|)
